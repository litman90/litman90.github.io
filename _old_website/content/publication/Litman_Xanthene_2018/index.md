abstract: Abstract The photophysical behavior of two xanthene dyes, Eosin Y and Phloxine
  B, included in microcrystalline cellulose particles is studied in a wide concentration
  range, with emphasis on the effect of dye concentration on fluorescence and triplet
  quantum yields. Absolute fluorescence quantum yields in the solid-state were determined
  by means of diffuse reflectance and steady-state fluorescence measurements, whereas
  absolute triplet quantum yields were obtained by laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy
  and their dependence on dye concentration was confirmed by diffuse reflectance laser
  flash photolysis and time-resolved phosphorescence measurements. When both quantum
  yields are corrected for reabsorption and reemission of radiation, ΦF values decrease
  strongly on increasing dye concentration, while a less pronounced decay is observed
  for ΦT. Fluorescence concentration quenching is attributed to the formation of dye
  aggregates or virtual traps resulting from molecular crowding. Dimeric traps are
  however able to generate triplet states. A mechanism based on the intermediacy of
  charge-transfer states is proposed and discussed. Calculation of parameters for
  photoinduced electron transfer between dye molecules within the traps evidences
  the feasibility of the proposed mechanism. Results demonstrate that photoactive
  energy traps, capable of yielding dye triplet states, can be formed even in highly-concentrated
  systems with random dye distributions.
