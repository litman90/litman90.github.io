 abstract = {We address the double hydrogen transfer (DHT) dynamics of the porphycene molecule, a complex paradigmatic system in which the making and breaking of H-bonds in a highly anharmonic potential energy surface require a quantum mechanical treatment not only of the electrons but also of the nuclei. We combine density functional theory calculations, employing hybrid functionals and van der Waals corrections, with recently proposed and optimized path-integral ring-polymer methods for the approximation of quantum vibrational spectra and reaction rates. Our full-dimensional ring-polymer instanton simulations show that below 100 K the concerted DHT tunneling pathway dominates but between 100 and 300 K there is a competition between concerted and stepwise pathways when nuclear quantum effects are included. We obtain ground-state reaction rates of 2.19 × 1011 s–1 at 150 K and 0.63 × 1011 s–1 at 100 K, in good agreement with experiment. We also reproduce the puzzling N–H stretching band of porphycene with very good accuracy from thermostated ring-polymer molecular dynamics simulations. The position and line shape of this peak, centered at around 2600 cm–1 and spanning 750 cm–1, stem from a combination of very strong H-bonds, the coupling to low-frequency modes, and the access to cis-like isomeric conformations, which cannot be appropriately captured with classical-nuclei dynamics. These results verify the appropriateness of our general theoretical approach and provide a framework for a deeper physical understanding of hydrogen transfer dynamics in complex systems.},
