abstract: Laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy (LIOAS), diffuse reflectance laser
  flash photolysis (DRLFP), and laser-induced luminescence (LIL) have been applied
  in conjunction to the determination of triplet state quantum yields of Rose Bengal
  (RB) supported on microcrystalline cellulose, a strongly light-scattering solid.
  Among the three used methods, the only one capable of providing absolute triplet
  quantum yields is LIOAS, but DRLFP and LIL aid in demonstrating that the LIOAS signal
  arises in fact from the triplet state and confirm the trend found with RB concentration.
  The coherence found for the three techniques demonstrates the usefulness of the
  approach. Observed triplet quantum yields are nearly constant within a limited concentration
  range, after which they decay strongly due to the generation of inactive dye aggregates
  or energy trapping centers. When quantum yields are divided by the fraction of absorbed
  light exciting the dye, the quotient falls off steadily with concentration, following
  the same trend as the observed fluorescence quantum yield. The conditions that maximize
  triplet formation are determined as a compromise between the rising light absorption
  and the decrease of quantum yield with RB concentration.
