The theoretical modeling of such reactions presents a formidable challenge for theory because nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) can play a prominent role and the coupling of the atomic motion with the electrons in the metal gives rise to important non-adiabatic effects (NAEs) that alter atomic dynamics. In this work, we derive a theoretical framework that captures both NQEs and NAEs and, due to its high efficiency, can be applied to first-principles calculations of reaction rates in high-dimensional realistic systems. More specifically, we develop a method that we coin ring polymer instanton with explicit friction (RPI-EF), starting from the ring polymer instanton formalism applied to a system–bath model. We derive general equations that incorporate the spatial and frequency dependence of the friction tensor and then combine this method with the ab initio electronic friction formalism for the calculation of thermal reaction rates. We show that the connection between RPI-EF and the form of the electronic friction tensor presented in this work does not require any further approximations, and it is expected to be valid as long as the approximations of both underlying theories remain valid.","tags":[],"title":"Dissipative tunneling rates through the incorporation of first-principles electronic friction in instanton rate theory.

Chem. Phys. (in press) (2022)], we presented the ring-polymer instanton with explicit friction (RPI-EF) method and showed how it can be connected to the ab initio electronic friction formalism. This framework allows for the calculation of tunneling reaction rates that incorporate the quantum nature of the nuclei and certain types of non-adiabatic effects (NAEs) present in metals. In this paper, we analyze the performance of RPI-EF on model potentials and apply it to realistic systems. For a 1D double-well model, we benchmark the method against numerically exact results obtained from multi-layer multi-configuration time-dependent Hartree calculations. We demonstrate that RPI-EF is accurate for medium and high friction strengths and less accurate for extremely low friction values. We also show quantitatively how the inclusion of NAEs lowers the crossover temperature into the deep tunneling regime, reduces the tunneling rates, and, in certain regimes, steers the quantum dynamics by modifying the tunneling pathways. As a showcase of the efficiency of this method, we present a study of hydrogen and deuterium hopping between neighboring interstitial sites in selected bulk metals. The results show that multidimensional vibrational coupling and nuclear quantum effects have a larger impact than NAEs on the tunneling rates of diffusion in metals. Together with Paper I [Litman et al., J. Chem. Phys. (in press) (2022)], these results advance the calculations of dissipative tunneling rates from first principles.","tags":[],"title":"Dissipative tunneling rates through the incorporation of first-principles electronic friction in instanton rate theory.

However, the microscopic mechanism of light scattering in such nonequilibrium systems is still imperfectly understood. Here, using low-temperature tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), we investigate how Raman scattering evolves as a function of the gap distance in the single C60-molecule junction consisting of an Ag tip and various metal surfaces. Precise gap-distance control allows the examination of two distinct transport regimes, namely tunneling regime and molecular point contact (MPC). Simultaneous measurement of TERS and the electric current in scanning tunneling microscopy shows that the MPC formation results in dramatic Raman enhancement that enables one to observe the vibrations undetectable in the tunneling regime. This enhancement is found to commonly occur not only for coinage but also transition metal substrates. We suggest that the characteristic enhancement upon the MPC formation is rationalized by charge-transfer excitation.","tags":[],"title":"Charge Transfer-Mediated Dramatic Enhancement of Raman Scattering upon Molecular Point Contact Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My research on this area has led to the following publications\n","date":164592e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":164592e4,"objectID":"01069887b2c278ee33ea585e208960cb","permalink":"https://litman90.github.io/website/project/aqueousinterfaces/","publishdate":"2022-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website/project/aqueousinterfaces/","section":"project","summary":"Where water meets the world: exploring the dynamic and complex realm of aqueous interfaces","tags":null,"title":"Aqueous Interfaces","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My research on this area has led to the following publications\n","date":164592e4,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":164592e4,"objectID":"85a7ee8be9c805d087ad6c4b301e60b5","permalink":"https://litman90.github.io/website/project/organic_inorganic_interfaces/","publishdate":"2022-02-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website/project/organic_inorganic_interfaces/","section":"project","summary":"Exploring the fascinating intersection where organic and inorganic worlds collide.","tags":null,"title":"Organic/Inorganic Interfaces","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My research on this area has led to the following publications\n","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"a65378aeb9b3d16c0df0047f665a6916","permalink":"https://litman90.github.io/website/project/vibrational_spectroscopy/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website/project/vibrational_spectroscopy/","section":"project","summary":"Using light to reveal the mysteries of molecular motion ","tags":null,"title":"Non-linear Vibrational Spectroscopy","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"My research on this area has led to the following publications\n","date":1643673600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1643673600,"objectID":"36b04ca4f8ed506632d4e36d20c028f2","permalink":"https://litman90.github.io/website/project/quantum_dynamics/","publishdate":"2022-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/website/project/quantum_dynamics/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding, predicting and manipulating nuclear quantum dynamics .","tags":null,"title":"Quantum Dynamics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Y.

This calls for the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) in the calculation of reaction rates even at high temperatures. However, computations of NQEs relying on standard parametrized dimensionality-reduced models quickly become inadequate in these environments. In this Letter, we study the paradigmatic molecular switch based on porphycene molecules adsorbed on metallic surfaces with full-dimensional calculations that combine density-functional theory for the electrons with the semiclassical ring-polymer instanton approximation for the nuclei. We show that the double intramolecular hydrogen transfer (DHT) rate can be enhanced by orders of magnitude due to surface fluctuations in the deep-tunneling regime. We also explain the origin of an Arrhenius temperature dependence of the rate below Tc and why this dependence differs at different surfaces. We propose a simple model to rationalize the temperature dependence of DHT rates spanning diverse fcc [110] surfaces.","tags":[],"title":"Multidimensional Hydrogen Tunneling in Supported Molecular Switches: The Role of Surface Interactions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Y.

Fully anharmonic temperature-dependent calculations of these quantities are challenging due to the cost associated with statistically converging trajectory-based methods, especially when accounting for nuclear quantum effects. Here, we train a high-dimensional neural network potential energy surface for the porphycene molecule based on data generated with DFT-B3LYP, including pairwise van der Waals interactions. In addition, we fit a kernel ridge regression model for the molecular dipole moment surface. The combination of this machinery with thermostatted path integral molecular dynamics (TRPMD) allows us to obtain well-converged, full-dimensional, fully-anharmonic vibrational spectra including nuclear quantum effects, without sacrificing the first-principles quality of the potential-energy surface or the dipole surface. Within this framework, we investigate the temperature and isotopologue dependence of the high-frequency vibrational fingerprints of porphycene. While classical-nuclei dynamics predicts a red shift of the vibrations encompassing the NH and CH stretches, TRPMD predicts a strong blue shift in the NH-stretch region and a smaller one in the CH-stretch region. We explain this behavior by analyzing the modulation of the effective potential with temperature, which arises from vibrational coupling between quasi-classical thermally activated modes and high-frequency quantized modes.","tags":["Yair"],"title":"Temperature dependence of the vibrational spectrum of porphycene: a qualitative failure of classical-nuclei molecular dynamics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stuart C.

This progress has been brought about by improvements in methods for evaluating interatomic forces that work by either solving the electronic structure problem explicitly, or by computing accurate approximations of the solution and by the development of techniques that use the Born–Oppenheimer (BO) forces to move the atoms on the BO potential energy surface. As a consequence of these developments it is now possible to identify stable or metastable states, to sample configurations consistent with the appropriate thermodynamic ensemble, and to estimate the kinetics of reactions and phase transitions. All too often, however, progress is slowed down by the bottleneck associated with implementing new optimization algorithms and/or sampling techniques into the many existing electronic-structure and empirical-potential codes. To address this problem, we are thus releasing a new version of the i-PI software. This piece of software is an easily extensible framework for implementing advanced atomistic simulation techniques using interatomic potentials and forces calculated by an external driver code. While the original version of the code (Ceriotti et al., 2014) was developed with a focus on path integral molecular dynamics techniques, this second release of i-PI not only includes several new advanced path integral methods, but also offers other classes of algorithms. In other words, i-PI is moving towards becoming a universal force engine that is both modular and tightly coupled to the driver codes that evaluate the potential energy surface and its derivatives.

Our full-dimensional ring-polymer instanton simulations show that below 100 K the concerted DHT tunneling pathway dominates but between 100 and 300 K there is a competition between concerted and stepwise pathways when nuclear quantum effects are included. We obtain ground-state reaction rates of 2.19 × 1011 s–1 at 150 K and 0.63 × 1011 s–1 at 100 K, in good agreement with experiment. We also reproduce the puzzling N–H stretching band of porphycene with very good accuracy from thermostated ring-polymer molecular dynamics simulations. The position and line shape of this peak, centered at around 2600 cm–1 and spanning 750 cm–1, stem from a combination of very strong H-bonds, the coupling to low-frequency modes, and the access to cis-like isomeric conformations, which cannot be appropriately captured with classical-nuclei dynamics. These results verify the appropriateness of our general theoretical approach and provide a framework for a deeper physical understanding of hydrogen transfer dynamics in complex systems.","tags":[],"title":"Elucidating the Nuclear Quantum Dynamics of Intramolecular Double Hydrogen Transfer in Porphycene","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yair Litman","Davide Donadio","Michele Ceriotti","Mariana Rossi"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1676122043,"objectID":"52d3b1a3fa1825295a3d6fbeb9b51082","permalink":"https://litman90.github.io/website/publication/litman-decisive-2018/","publishdate":"2023-02-11T13:27:23.45433Z","relpermalink":"/website/publication/litman-decisive-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"Water molecules adsorbed on inorganic substrates play an important role in several technological applications. In the presence of light atoms in adsorbates, nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) influence the structural stability and the dynamical properties of these systems. In this work, we explore the impact of NQEs on the dissociation of water wires on stepped Pt(221) surfaces. By performing ab initio molecular dynamics simulations with van der Waals corrected density functional theory, we note that several competing minima for both intact and dissociated structures are accessible at finite temperatures, making it important to assess whether harmonic estimates of the quantum free energy are sufficient to determine the relative stability of the different states. We thus perform ab initio path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) in order to calculate these contributions taking into account the conformational entropy and anharmonicities at finite temperatures. We propose that when adsorption is weak and NQEs on the substrate are negligible, PIMD simulations can be performed through a simple partition of the system, resulting in considerable computational savings. We then calculate the full contribution of NQEs to the free energies, including also anharmonic terms. We find that they result in an increase of up to 20% of the quantum contribution to the dissociation free energy compared with the harmonic estimates. We also find that the dissociation process has a negligible contribution from tunneling but is dominated by zero point energies, which can enhance the rate of dissociation by three orders of magnitude. Finally we highlight how both temperature and NQEs indirectly impact dipoles and the redistribution of electron density, causing work function changes of up to 0.4 eV with respect to static estimates. This quantitative determination of the change in the work function provides a possible approach to determine experimentally the most stable configurations of water oligomers on the stepped surfaces.","tags":[],"title":"Decisive role of nuclear quantum effects on surface mediated water dissociation at finite temperature","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Takashi Kumagai","Janina N.

It is revealed that the trans configuration is the thermodynamically stable form of porphycene on Cu(111) and Ag(111), whereas the cis configuration occurs as a meta-stable form. The trans → cis or cis → trans conversion on Cu(111) can be induced in an unidirectional fashion by injecting tunneling electrons from the STM tip or heating the surface, respectively. We find that the cis ↔ cis tautomerization on Cu(111) occurs spontaneously via tunneling, verified by the negligible temperature dependence of the tautomerization rate below ∼23 K. Van der Waals corrected DFT calculations are used to characterize the adsorption structures of porphycene and to map the potential energy surface of the tautomerization on Cu(111). The calculated barriers are too high to be thermally overcome at cryogenic temperatures used in the experiment and zero-point energy corrections do not change this picture, leaving tunneling as the most likely mechanism. On Ag(111), the reversible trans ↔ cis conversion occurs spontaneously at 5 K and the cis ↔ cis tautomerization rate is much higher than on Cu(111), indicating a significantly smaller tautomerization barrier on Ag(111) due to the weaker interaction between porphycene and the surface compared to Cu(111). Additionally, the STM experiments and DFT calculations reveal that tautomerization on Cu(111) and Ag(111) occurs with migration of porphycene along the surface; thus, the translational motion couples with the tautomerization coordinate. On the other hand, the trans and cis configurations are not discernible in the STM image and no tautomerization is observed for porphycene on Au(111). The weak interaction of porphycene with Au(111) is closest to the gas-phase limit and therefore the absence of trans and cis configurations in the STM images is explained either by the rapid tautomerization rate or the similar character of the molecular frontier orbitals of the trans and cis configurations.","tags":[],"title":"Quantum tunneling in real space: Tautomerization of single porphycene molecules on the (111) surface of Cu, Ag, and Au","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yair E.

Absolute fluorescence quantum yields in the solid-state were determined by means of diffuse reflectance and steady-state fluorescence measurements, whereas absolute triplet quantum yields were obtained by laser-induced optoacoustic spectroscopy and their dependence on dye concentration was confirmed by diffuse reflectance laser flash photolysis and time-resolved phosphorescence measurements. When both quantum yields are corrected for reabsorption and reemission of radiation, ΦF values decrease strongly on increasing dye concentration, while a less pronounced decay is observed for ΦT. Fluorescence concentration quenching is attributed to the formation of dye aggregates or virtual traps resulting from molecular crowding. Dimeric traps are however able to generate triplet states. A mechanism based on the intermediacy of charge-transfer states is proposed and discussed. Calculation of parameters for photoinduced electron transfer between dye molecules within the traps evidences the feasibility of the proposed mechanism. Results demonstrate that photoactive energy traps, capable of yielding dye triplet states, can be formed even in highly-concentrated systems with random dye distributions.","tags":[],"title":"Photophysics of Xanthene Dyes at High Concentrations in Solid Environments: Charge Transfer Assisted Triplet Formation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yair E.

To allow for an adequate description of proton transfer processes, our simulation scheme resorted on the implementation of a multistate empirical valence bond hamiltonian coupled to a path integral scheme to account for effects derived from nuclear quantum fluctuations. We focused attention on clusters comprising a number of water molecules close to the threshold values necessary to stabilize contact-ion-pairs. For X = F, our results reveal a clear propensity of the heavy isotope to lie at the bond bridging the halide to the nearest water molecule. Contrasting, for X = I, the thermodynamic stability is reversed and the former connectivity is preferentially articulated via the light isotope. These trends remain valid for undissociated and ionic descriptions of the stable valence bond states. The preferences are rationalized in terms of differences in the quantum kinetic energies of the isotopes which, in turn, reflect the extent of the local spatial confinements prevailing along the different hydrogen bonds in the clusters. In most cases, these features are also clearly reflected in the characteristics of the corresponding stretching bands of the simulated infrared spectra. This opens interesting possibilities to gauge the extent of the isotopic thermodynamic stabilizations and the strengths of the different hydrogen bonds by following the magnitudes and shifts of the spectral signals in temperature-controlled experiments, performed on mixed clusters combining H2O and HOD.","tags":[],"title":"Positional Isotope Exchange in HX·(H2O)n (X = F, I) Clusters at Low Temperatures","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yair Litman","Hernán B.

The maximum singlet oxygen generation efficiency (quantum yield × absorption factor) lies at concentrations around 2 wt%, where fluorescence self quenching amounts to more than 80%.

Among the three used methods, the only one capable of providing absolute triplet quantum yields is LIOAS, but DRLFP and LIL aid in demonstrating that the LIOAS signal arises in fact from the triplet state and confirm the trend found with RB concentration. The coherence found for the three techniques demonstrates the usefulness of the approach. Observed triplet quantum yields are nearly constant within a limited concentration range, after which they decay strongly due to the generation of inactive dye aggregates or energy trapping centers. When quantum yields are divided by the fraction of absorbed light exciting the dye, the quotient falls off steadily with concentration, following the same trend as the observed fluorescence quantum yield. The conditions that maximize triplet formation are determined as a compromise between the rising light absorption and the decrease of quantum yield with RB concentration.","tags":[],"title":"Effect of Concentration on the Formation of Rose Bengal Triplet State on Microcrystalline Cellulose: A Combined Laser-Induced Optoacoustic Spectroscopy, Diffuse Reflectance Flash Photolysis, and Luminescence Study","type":"publication"}]
