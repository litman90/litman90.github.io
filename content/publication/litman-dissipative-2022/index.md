abstract: Reactions involving adsorbates on metallic surfaces and impurities in bulk
  metals are ubiquitous in a wide range of technological applications. The theoretical
  modeling of such reactions presents a formidable challenge for theory because nuclear
  quantum effects (NQEs) can play a prominent role and the coupling of the atomic
  motion with the electrons in the metal gives rise to important non-adiabatic effects
  (NAEs) that alter atomic dynamics. In this work, we derive a theoretical framework
  that captures both NQEs and NAEs and, due to its high efficiency, can be applied
  to first-principles calculations of reaction rates in high-dimensional realistic
  systems. More specifically, we develop a method that we coin ring polymer instanton
  with explicit friction (RPI-EF), starting from the ring polymer instanton formalism
  applied to a system–bath model. We derive general equations that incorporate the
  spatial and frequency dependence of the friction tensor and then combine this method
  with the ab initio electronic friction formalism for the calculation of thermal
  reaction rates. We show that the connection between RPI-EF and the form of the electronic
  friction tensor presented in this work does not require any further approximations,
  and it is expected to be valid as long as the approximations of both underlying
  theories remain valid.
