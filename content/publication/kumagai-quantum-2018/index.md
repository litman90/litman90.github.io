abstract: Tautomerization in single porphycene molecules is investigated on Cu(111),
  Ag(111), and Au(111) surfaces by a combination of low-temperature scanning tunneling
  microscopy (STM) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It
  is revealed that the trans configuration is the thermodynamically stable form of
  porphycene on Cu(111) and Ag(111), whereas the cis configuration occurs as a meta-stable
  form. The trans → cis or cis → trans conversion on Cu(111) can be induced in an
  unidirectional fashion by injecting tunneling electrons from the STM tip or heating
  the surface, respectively. We find that the cis ↔ cis tautomerization on Cu(111)
  occurs spontaneously via tunneling, verified by the negligible temperature dependence
  of the tautomerization rate below ∼23 K. Van der Waals corrected DFT calculations
  are used to characterize the adsorption structures of porphycene and to map the
  potential energy surface of the tautomerization on Cu(111). The calculated barriers
  are too high to be thermally overcome at cryogenic temperatures used in the experiment
  and zero-point energy corrections do not change this picture, leaving tunneling
  as the most likely mechanism. On Ag(111), the reversible trans ↔ cis conversion
  occurs spontaneously at 5 K and the cis ↔ cis tautomerization rate is much higher
  than on Cu(111), indicating a significantly smaller tautomerization barrier on Ag(111)
  due to the weaker interaction between porphycene and the surface compared to Cu(111).
  Additionally, the STM experiments and DFT calculations reveal that tautomerization
  on Cu(111) and Ag(111) occurs with migration of porphycene along the surface; thus,
  the translational motion couples with the tautomerization coordinate. On the other
  hand, the trans and cis configurations are not discernible in the STM image and
  no tautomerization is observed for porphycene on Au(111). The weak interaction of
  porphycene with Au(111) is closest to the gas-phase limit and therefore the absence
  of trans and cis configurations in the STM images is explained either by the rapid
  tautomerization rate or the similar character of the molecular frontier orbitals
  of the trans and cis configurations.
