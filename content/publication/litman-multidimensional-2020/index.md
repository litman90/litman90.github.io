abstract: The nuclear tunneling crossover temperature (Tc) of hydrogen transfer reactions
  in supported molecular-switch architectures can lie close to room temperature. This
  calls for the inclusion of nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) in the calculation of
  reaction rates even at high temperatures. However, computations of NQEs relying
  on standard parametrized dimensionality-reduced models quickly become inadequate
  in these environments. In this Letter, we study the paradigmatic molecular switch
  based on porphycene molecules adsorbed on metallic surfaces with full-dimensional
  calculations that combine density-functional theory for the electrons with the semiclassical
  ring-polymer instanton approximation for the nuclei. We show that the double intramolecular
  hydrogen transfer (DHT) rate can be enhanced by orders of magnitude due to surface
  fluctuations in the deep-tunneling regime. We also explain the origin of an Arrhenius
  temperature dependence of the rate below Tc and why this dependence differs at different
  surfaces. We propose a simple model to rationalize the temperature dependence of
  DHT rates spanning diverse fcc [110] surfaces.
