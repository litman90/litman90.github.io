abstract: The temperature dependence of vibrational spectra can provide information
  about structural changes of a system and also serve as a probe to identify different
  vibrational mode couplings. Fully anharmonic temperature-dependent calculations
  of these quantities are challenging due to the cost associated with statistically
  converging trajectory-based methods, especially when accounting for nuclear quantum
  effects. Here, we train a high-dimensional neural network potential energy surface
  for the porphycene molecule based on data generated with DFT-B3LYP, including pairwise
  van der Waals interactions. In addition, we fit a kernel ridge regression model
  for the molecular dipole moment surface. The combination of this machinery with
  thermostatted path integral molecular dynamics (TRPMD) allows us to obtain well-converged,
  full-dimensional, fully-anharmonic vibrational spectra including nuclear quantum
  effects, without sacrificing the first-principles quality of the potential-energy
  surface or the dipole surface. Within this framework, we investigate the temperature
  and isotopologue dependence of the high-frequency vibrational fingerprints of porphycene.
  While classical-nuclei dynamics predicts a red shift of the vibrations encompassing
  the NH and CH stretches, TRPMD predicts a strong blue shift in the NH-stretch region
  and a smaller one in the CH-stretch region. We explain this behavior by analyzing
  the modulation of the effective potential with temperature, which arises from vibrational
  coupling between quasi-classical thermally activated modes and high-frequency quantized
  modes.
