abstract: In Paper I [Litman et al., J. Chem. Phys. (in press) (2022)], we presented
  the ring-polymer instanton with explicit friction (RPI-EF) method and showed how
  it can be connected to the ab initio electronic friction formalism. This framework
  allows for the calculation of tunneling reaction rates that incorporate the quantum
  nature of the nuclei and certain types of non-adiabatic effects (NAEs) present in
  metals. In this paper, we analyze the performance of RPI-EF on model potentials
  and apply it to realistic systems. For a 1D double-well model, we benchmark the
  method against numerically exact results obtained from multi-layer multi-configuration
  time-dependent Hartree calculations. We demonstrate that RPI-EF is accurate for
  medium and high friction strengths and less accurate for extremely low friction
  values. We also show quantitatively how the inclusion of NAEs lowers the crossover
  temperature into the deep tunneling regime, reduces the tunneling rates, and, in
  certain regimes, steers the quantum dynamics by modifying the tunneling pathways.
  As a showcase of the efficiency of this method, we present a study of hydrogen and
  deuterium hopping between neighboring interstitial sites in selected bulk metals.
  The results show that multidimensional vibrational coupling and nuclear quantum
  effects have a larger impact than NAEs on the tunneling rates of diffusion in metals.
  Together with Paper I [Litman et al., J. Chem. Phys. (in press) (2022)], these results
  advance the calculations of dissipative tunneling rates from first principles.
