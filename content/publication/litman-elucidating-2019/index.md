abstract: We address the double hydrogen transfer (DHT) dynamics of the porphycene
  molecule, a complex paradigmatic system in which the making and breaking of H-bonds
  in a highly anharmonic potential energy surface require a quantum mechanical treatment
  not only of the electrons but also of the nuclei. We combine density functional
  theory calculations, employing hybrid functionals and van der Waals corrections,
  with recently proposed and optimized path-integral ring-polymer methods for the
  approximation of quantum vibrational spectra and reaction rates. Our full-dimensional
  ring-polymer instanton simulations show that below 100 K the concerted DHT tunneling
  pathway dominates but between 100 and 300 K there is a competition between concerted
  and stepwise pathways when nuclear quantum effects are included. We obtain ground-state
  reaction rates of 2.19 × 1011 s–1 at 150 K and 0.63 × 1011 s–1 at 100 K, in good
  agreement with experiment. We also reproduce the puzzling N–H stretching band of
  porphycene with very good accuracy from thermostated ring-polymer molecular dynamics
  simulations. The position and line shape of this peak, centered at around 2600 cm–1
  and spanning 750 cm–1, stem from a combination of very strong H-bonds, the coupling
  to low-frequency modes, and the access to cis-like isomeric conformations, which
  cannot be appropriately captured with classical-nuclei dynamics. These results verify
  the appropriateness of our general theoretical approach and provide a framework
  for a deeper physical understanding of hydrogen transfer dynamics in complex systems.
