abstract: Water molecules adsorbed on inorganic substrates play an important role
  in several technological applications. In the presence of light atoms in adsorbates,
  nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) influence the structural stability and the dynamical
  properties of these systems. In this work, we explore the impact of NQEs on the
  dissociation of water wires on stepped Pt(221) surfaces. By performing ab initio
  molecular dynamics simulations with van der Waals corrected density functional theory,
  we note that several competing minima for both intact and dissociated structures
  are accessible at finite temperatures, making it important to assess whether harmonic
  estimates of the quantum free energy are sufficient to determine the relative stability
  of the different states. We thus perform ab initio path integral molecular dynamics
  (PIMD) in order to calculate these contributions taking into account the conformational
  entropy and anharmonicities at finite temperatures. We propose that when adsorption
  is weak and NQEs on the substrate are negligible, PIMD simulations can be performed
  through a simple partition of the system, resulting in considerable computational
  savings. We then calculate the full contribution of NQEs to the free energies, including
  also anharmonic terms. We find that they result in an increase of up to 20% of the
  quantum contribution to the dissociation free energy compared with the harmonic
  estimates. We also find that the dissociation process has a negligible contribution
  from tunneling but is dominated by zero point energies, which can enhance the rate
  of dissociation by three orders of magnitude. Finally we highlight how both temperature
  and NQEs indirectly impact dipoles and the redistribution of electron density, causing
  work function changes of up to 0.4 eV with respect to static estimates. This quantitative
  determination of the change in the work function provides a possible approach to
  determine experimentally the most stable configurations of water oligomers on the
  stepped surfaces.
