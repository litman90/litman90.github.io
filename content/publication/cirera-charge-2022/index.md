abstract: Charge-transfer enhancement of Raman scattering plays a crucial role in
  current-carrying molecular junctions. However, the microscopic mechanism of light
  scattering in such nonequilibrium systems is still imperfectly understood. Here,
  using low-temperature tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), we investigate how
  Raman scattering evolves as a function of the gap distance in the single C60-molecule
  junction consisting of an Ag tip and various metal surfaces. Precise gap-distance
  control allows the examination of two distinct transport regimes, namely tunneling
  regime and molecular point contact (MPC). Simultaneous measurement of TERS and the
  electric current in scanning tunneling microscopy shows that the MPC formation results
  in dramatic Raman enhancement that enables one to observe the vibrations undetectable
  in the tunneling regime. This enhancement is found to commonly occur not only for
  coinage but also transition metal substrates. We suggest that the characteristic
  enhancement upon the MPC formation is rationalized by charge-transfer excitation.
