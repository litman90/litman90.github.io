 abstract = {Charge-transfer enhancement of Raman scattering plays a crucial role in current-carrying molecular junctions. However, the microscopic mechanism of light scattering in such nonequilibrium systems is still imperfectly understood. Here, using low-temperature tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS), we investigate how Raman scattering evolves as a function of the gap distance in the single C60-molecule junction consisting of an Ag tip and various metal surfaces. Precise gap-distance control allows the examination of two distinct transport regimes, namely tunneling regime and molecular point contact (MPC). Simultaneous measurement of TERS and the electric current in scanning tunneling microscopy shows that the MPC formation results in dramatic Raman enhancement that enables one to observe the vibrations undetectable in the tunneling regime. This enhancement is found to commonly occur not only for coinage but also transition metal substrates. We suggest that the characteristic enhancement upon the MPC formation is rationalized by charge-transfer excitation.},
