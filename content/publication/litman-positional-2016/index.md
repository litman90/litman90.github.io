abstract: We present molecular dynamics simulation results describing proton/deuteron
  exchange equilibria along hydrogen bonds at the vicinity of HX acids (X = F, I)
  in aqueous clusters at low temperatures. To allow for an adequate description of
  proton transfer processes, our simulation scheme resorted on the implementation
  of a multistate empirical valence bond hamiltonian coupled to a path integral scheme
  to account for effects derived from nuclear quantum fluctuations. We focused attention
  on clusters comprising a number of water molecules close to the threshold values
  necessary to stabilize contact-ion-pairs. For X = F, our results reveal a clear
  propensity of the heavy isotope to lie at the bond bridging the halide to the nearest
  water molecule. Contrasting, for X = I, the thermodynamic stability is reversed
  and the former connectivity is preferentially articulated via the light isotope.
  These trends remain valid for undissociated and ionic descriptions of the stable
  valence bond states. The preferences are rationalized in terms of differences in
  the quantum kinetic energies of the isotopes which, in turn, reflect the extent
  of the local spatial confinements prevailing along the different hydrogen bonds
  in the clusters. In most cases, these features are also clearly reflected in the
  characteristics of the corresponding stretching bands of the simulated infrared
  spectra. This opens interesting possibilities to gauge the extent of the isotopic
  thermodynamic stabilizations and the strengths of the different hydrogen bonds by
  following the magnitudes and shifts of the spectral signals in temperature-controlled
  experiments, performed on mixed clusters combining H2O and HOD.
