abstract: Fluorescence and singlet molecular oxygen (1O2) quantum yields for phloxine
  B loaded poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) thin films are determined at dye concentrations
  from 0.015 to 22 wt%. Fluorescence self-quenching and the fall off of the 1O2 quantum
  yield observed above 0.1 wt% are attributed to very weakly interacting close-lying
  dye molecules acting as energy traps arising from molecular confinement. The maximum
  singlet oxygen generation efficiency (quantum yield × absorption factor) lies at
  concentrations around 2 wt%, where fluorescence self quenching amounts to more than
  80%. Data are fitted quantitatively by using a quenching radius model involving
  energy migration and trapping with rQ = 1.2 nm. The present results constitute a
  proof of concept for the rational design of heterogeneous photosensitizers in general
  and, particularly, for applications in which the antimicrobial activity of singlet
  oxygen is central.
